## Flavor Canon (IMPORTANT)

Each flavor name is a **character**, not a descriptor.

| Flavor Asset | Canon Name |
|--------------|------------|
| Black Cherry | **Cougar Juice** |
| Blackberry | **Bonus Round** |
| Cranberry Lime | **Partymaker** |
| Grapefruit | **Vibe Machine** |
| Lime | **Fiesta Fuel** |
| Peach | **The Fuzz** |
| Pineapple | **Retox** |
| Tangerine | **Aiming Fluid** |

Rules:
- Never use literal flavor names as headlines.
- Canon names always take priority.
- Fruit descriptors may appear in supporting copy only.

Example:
**Bonus Round**  
Blackberry + premium vodka.

## Flavor Color Canon

Each flavor owns **one canonical color** derived directly from its can design.

These colors are **identity accents**, not decorative UI colors.

### Color Usage Rules
- One HEX color per flavor.
- Colors may be used only for micro-accents:
  - dividers
  - rules
  - hover underlines
  - small UI highlights
- Colors must NEVER be used as large backgrounds.
- The global UI remains black, white, and neutral.
- If color is not necessary, do not use it.
